An example of using BeamRealSpaceMatchedFilter to find point sources.

Using Sigurd's maps: ~sigurdkn/data/actpol/maps/s4test3/cmb_huge

Look at the .par files to see which maps are used there, and copy/link them into this directory. 
Note that since Sigurd's maps include polarisation, the script makeSigurd1D.py should be used to 
extract the temperature map only.

For testing out the code, run: 

nemo AdvACT_PointSources_quick.par

This is very quick (~30 sec), as it uses only a small part of the map. Under the 
AdvACT_PointSources_quick directory that is created, you'll find the catalogs and filtered maps in
the usual format.

To run over the whole map, use:

nemo AdvACT_PointSources.par

This will start thrashing the disk on a machine with 8 Gb of RAM.
