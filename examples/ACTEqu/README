This directory contains a .par file for running over the ACT
equatorial maps that are available on LAMBDA. You'll need the files
named:

* ACT_148_equ_season_3_1way_hits_v3.fits  
* ACT_148_equ_season_3_1way_v3_src_free.fits

You'll then need to edit the .par file accordingly to point to 
wherever these live on your machine. In practice, one would make
a weighted average of all of the season / array maps and run on
that to reach the full depth.

This example runs only a single cluster model, but you add
(uncomment) as many more as you like - they will be combined to
make an "optimal" catalog. It just takes longer.

For speed, this example runs over only a small section of the map,
which you can adjust with the RADecSection key in the .par file.

To run:

% nemo equ.par

For the settings in this example, this should take ~20 sec on an
Intel Core i5-3320M (2.60 GHz). Subsequent runs (if you fiddle with
the code and decide to re-run, for example) will be quicker, if you 
don't modify the filters, as they are cached.

Output will be written to a directory called 'equ', in which you
will find:

* equ/diagnostics           - various diagnostic plots
* equ/filteredMaps          - the filtered maps themselves, with .reg
                              files for each model
* equ/equ_optimal_catalog.* - the combined, optimal catalog, in
                              various formats 

The file Hasselfield2013_upp.fits contains the Hasselfield et al.
(2013) catalog, if you want to compare by cross matching using
TopCat. Please note the different area and maps used in this quick
example when doing so.

Note that the output for photometric measurements (Y500 etc.) is not
correct at the moment - this was being experimented with a while ago 
and has been left 'as is'.
