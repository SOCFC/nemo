nemo - map filtering and cluster detection code

This is a slightly edited version of the original code, for posting on ACT github.
There may be all sorts of weird things in here that don't make sense, wrong turns, and all the rest

I have disabled the code that does the catalog matching and (static) web page generation as
that is all now handled by the sourcery package - which runs a live, editable web database. All
of the photometry routines (for measuring Y etc.) are also disabled at the moment. But you
can get signal-to-noise values. All of this will be tidied up if the code is eventually 
refactored.

Required python modules (current versions running on given in brackets, earlier versions probably work):

* pyfits (2.1.3)
* numpy (1.5)
* scipy (0.7.2)
* matplotlib (0.99.3)
* astLib (svn possibly, if so: svn co https://astlib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astlib/trunk astlib) 
* flipper (0.1.3)

Cython is now needed for the inserting fake sources completeness sim stuff.

The fake source sims are run from the main nemo script, and output is written 
under <outDir>/diagnostics/fakeSourceSims. A .par file with the settings for 
running completeness sims is included 
(examples/equS82AR1Only_MatchedProfile_simpleNoise_backsub_season234_narrow.par).
All the action is under simTools.fakeSourceSims.

IPython isn't really required, but I like to throw in ipshells() all over the place when testing (comment out
the ipshell import at the top of each file if necessary).

To install:

 - as root:
   % sudo python setup.py install

 - to home directory:
   % python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local
   Then add $HOME/local/bin to $PATH, and e.g. $HOME/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages to $PYTHONPATH

To run:

  % nemo <.par file>

  See the examples/ dir for example .par files (and also Ryan's temperature profiles)
