# Testing nemo

This directory contains tests, which use the Robot Framework:

http://robotframework.org/

To run a single test do, e.g.,

```
robot point_sources.robot
```

To run all of the tests, do:

```
robot -N "Nemo Tests" *.robot
```

Check the `plots/` directory for output from some tests.
